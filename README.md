# Approaches

## TypeWriter
The TypeWriter is proposed by:
```
Pradel, M., Gousios, G., Liu, J., & Chandra, S. (2019). TypeWriter: Neural Type Prediction with Search-based Validation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.03768.
```

### Script

The re-implementation of this approach consists of two parts:

 - Extractor: To process functions and generate data vectors, use the following script:
```
python TW_extractor.py --o $OUTPUT_FOLDER --d $REPOS --w $THREADS
```
`$OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Specify a folder to store the output files. The folder will be created automatically.

`$REPOS`: The path to Python projects

`$THREADS`: Number of workers for extracting functions from the projects.

- Model: To learn the neural model and do prediction, run the following script:
```
python TW_model.py --o $OUTPUT_FOLDER
```
`$OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Note that this is the output folder that you specified in the extractor part.

To change the hyper-parameters of the neural model, you can change the values in the file `data/tw_model_learning_params.json`.

It should be noted that both Extractor and Model scripts save the required files for running the inference script in `$OUTPUT_FOLDER/tw_model_files`.

### Notebook
To run all the steps of TypeWriter manually with explanation, check out the notebook `main_TW.ipynb`.

### Inference 
By employing the pre-trained neural model of TypeWriter, you can infer both argument and return types of the methods of a given Python source file using the following script:

```
python TW_inference.py --s $SRC_FILE --m $TW_MODEL_PATH --t $TOP_K
```

`$SRC_FILE`: A Python source file.

`$TW_MODEL_PATH`: The path to the TypeWriter's pre-trained model and auxiliary files.

`$TOP_K`: Top K predictions (the default value of K is 3)
